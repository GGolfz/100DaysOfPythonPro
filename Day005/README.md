# Day 5 Loops

# Ex 5.1 Average Height

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# Ex 5.2 Highest Score

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: 91

# Ex 5.3 Adding Evens

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including 1 and 100.

e.g. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Ex 5.4 FizzBuzz

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
