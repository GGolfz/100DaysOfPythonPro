# Day 4 Randomisation and Lists

## Ex 4.1 Heads or Tails

You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.

Don't worry about the lines 3-4, it's there to allow us to test your code.

You need to generate a random number, either 0 or 1.

1 means Heads

0 means Tails 

## Ex 4.2 Who's Paying

You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

## Ex 4.3 Treasure Map

You are going to write a program which will mark a spot with an X.

The map is made of 3 rows of blank squares.

    1     2     3
1 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
2 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
3 ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

Your program should allow you to enter the position of the treasure using a two-digit system. The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number.
